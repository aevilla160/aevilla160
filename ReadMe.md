## About Who I Am:

I am Alex, a current undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced. My primary course work has given me elementray exposure to core CS foundationals, such as Algorithms & Design, Data Structures, Linear Algebra and Applications of Parallel Computing. 

I also work with high performance computing in the form of cluster maintance and assiting researchers with usage of HPC resources to accelerate research. This has led me to further learn and research into HPC and it's associated technologies. 

I am a undergraduate research assistant, primarly working with HPC and collective communication libraries. My most recent work has been to analyze and make comparisons of Horovod and it's collective communication wrappers when comparing their computation time to standard MPI collective communication operations.
