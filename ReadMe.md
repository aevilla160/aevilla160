# Hello There 👋

## About Who I Am:

I am Alex, a current undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced. 

My main research interests are in Distributed Memory Parallelism(MPI, NCCL), and scalable parallel algorithm designs and their applications to deep learning and scientific computing.
