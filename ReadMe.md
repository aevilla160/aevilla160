# Hello There 👋

## About Who I Am:

I am Alex, a current undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced. My primary course work has given me to CS foundationals, such as Algorithms & Design, Data Structures, Linear Algebra and Applications of Parallel Computing. 

I am a undergraduate research assistant, primarly working with HPC and collective communication libraries. My most recent work has been to analyze and make comparisons of Horovod and it's collective communication wrappers when comparing their computation time to standard MPI collective communication operations. My main research interests are in Collective Communication(MPI, NCCL), GPU Offloading and data paralellism. 

I am  Visiting Student in the Parallel Computing Summer Research program at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
